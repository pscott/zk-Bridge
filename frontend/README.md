## Getting Started

First install all dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result (it could be another port if that one is unavailable).
